Professionally, I'm a Sr. Manager of Site Reliability Engineering with a broad range of Unix/Linux experience. I'm particularly interested in Open Source, configuration management, infrastructure as code, and software
development environments.

Personally, I'm a husband, a father, a caffeine addict (ask how many different coffee makers I have at home), and a fan of mashup music.

Abstractly, I'm a collection of atoms.
